17	Vegetarian Stir-Fry	Save time and money by purchasing a package of frozen vegetables. These vegetables are typically picked at their peak and frozen quickly to lock in their natural nutrients while also maintaining flavor. The seasoning from the rice, oil, and sauce will provide plenty of flavors to keep this meal from being anything but bland. For the true vegan, skip the egg and garnish the dish with either bean sprouts or sliced chives.	\N	\N	4	25	5	3	t	4	vegetable-stir-fry.jpg	0

33	Completely Crock Pot Spaghetti and Meatballs	You can vary the amount of pasta or meatballs according to your taste. Just make sure that the pasta is submerged in the liquid before you start the crock pot.  You can also add more ingredients—some chopped onion or garlic if your family likes it, or some shredded carrots would add flavor and nutrition. You could add some chicken or beef broth in place of the water for a more flavorful dish.  Top the cooked pasta and meatballs with some grated Parmesan cheese. For a complete meal, all you need is some toasted garlic bread and a green salad tossed with mushrooms and avocados.	\N	\N	4	360	10	6	t	32	spaghetti-meatballs.jpg	0

135	Easiest Baked Chicken Breast	https://iowagirleats.com/easiest-baked-chicken-breast/ . If your chicken breasts are 10oz+, pound them out then cut them in half to ensure they cook evenly. Really any prepared vinaigrette/dressing will work for this chicken, though creamy dressings like Ranch or French dressing will burn in the oven. I almost always use Ken's Zesty Italian salad dressing, but your favorite balsamic vinegar, lemon vinaigrette, or Asian-style dressing are all fine to use. If you don’t have a salad dressing on hand that you’d like to use, feel free to simply brush the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil then add your seasonings and bake as directed.	\N	\N	4	10	0	1	t	0	baked-chicken-breast.jpg	0
136	Easy Chicken Fried Rice	https://iowagirleats.com/take-out-fake-out-easy-chicken-fried-rice - How I make my rice: add 1 cup long grain white rice (I like Lundberg Farms) 1-3/4 cup water, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and pinch of salt to a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer then place a lid on top and turn heat down to medium-low. The water should barely be bubbling. Cook for 10 minutes then remove pan from the heat and let sit with the lid on for 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork then spread out onto a plate to cool. Yields: 3 cups cooked rice.	\N	\N	4	10	0	1	t	0	chicken-fried-rice.jpg	0
137	Meatballs	https://www.mamaknowsglutenfree.com/gluten-free-meatballs/ - For dairy-free option: use unsweetened almond milk and dairy-free bread crumbs. Store leftovers in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. To freeze: Once the gluten-free meatballs are completely cooled, the meatballs will need to be flash frozen first. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Transfer the frozen, cooked meatballs to freezer bags or freezer-safe containers and place them in your freezer. To reheat: The meatballs easily heated up in the oven, microwave or in a pot of spaghetti sauce. You can also defrosted the meatballs overnight in the refrigerator. To make ahead: Cover the raw meatballs as instructed with plastic wrap or an air-tight container and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.	\N	\N	0	25	5	12	t	2	meatballs.jpg	0
138	Warm Chicken and Vegetable Salad	Use other lean meat, such as turkey breast, or lean cuts of beef or pork, in place of the chicken.	\N	\N	4	10	7	6	t	4	chicken-vegetable-salad.jpg	0
139	Crock Pot Salsa Chicken	https://iowagirleats.com/crock-pot-salsa-chicken/#recipe-card - I like Clint's Mild Salsa, which is gluten free. You may use 2 Tablespoons of my Large Batch Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix in place of the blend listed above. Feel free to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs — or a mixture of these and chicken breasts — to equal 2lbs. To store: cool the shredded chicken then scoop into a storage container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for 3-4 days. To freeze: cool the shredded chicken then scoop into a gallon-size freezer bag, remove the air, seal, and freeze flat for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator. To make freezer meal packs: add the uncooked ingredients into a gallon-size freezer bag then remove the air, seal, and freeze flat for up to 6 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator before following recipe directions. How to use the shredded salsa chicken: Nachos: dollop tortilla chips with shredded chicken and cheese then melt in the oven and load up with your favorite toppings. Tacos: fill crunchy taco shells with shredded chicken then add your toppings. Enchiladas: use the flavorful salsa chicken as the filling in Chicken Enchiladas. Burritos: roll salsa chicken with cooked rice, beans, salsa, and cheese in your favorite large tortilla. Tostadas: toast corn tortillas then spread with Creamy Pinto Beans, the shredded salsa chicken, and shredded cheese. Melt then dollop with guacamole. Soups: add the tex-mex chicken to Restaurant-Style Chicken Tortilla Soup to save yourself a step. Salads: chill the shredded chicken then add to lettuce with shredded cheese, black beans, tomatoes, green onions, and tortilla strips. Serve with a mixture of equal parts salsa and ranch dressing. Burrito Bowls: pair the shredded chicken with cilantro lime rice, black beans, and all the fresh fixins. Quesadillas: pair with shredded cheese and tortillas then crisp to a golden crunch. Dip in a mixture of equal parts salsa and guacamole.	\N	\N	4	300	5	4	t	32	crock-pot-salsa-chicken.jpg	0
140	Spiced Chicken Risotto with Mint	Use the same quantity of pumpkin or butternut squash in place of the carrots. To make a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and add a drained 400g/14oz can of chickpeas to the rice just before the end of cooking.	\N	\N	6	15	5	4	t	4	\N	0
141	Chicken Fried Rice	If you don't have any cold cooked rice in the refrigerator, you can still make this stir-fry if you have a couple of pouches of instant or express long grain or basmati rice in the cupboard. This type of rice cooks in under 2 minutes. For a stir-fry, the rice should be cold, so spread it out on a baking sheet after cooking and fan it to cool it quickly.	\N	\N	4	10	5	4	t	4	chicken-fried-rice.jpg	0
142	Frothy Hot Chocolate	You could use Mexican chocolate, which is flavoured with almonds, cinnamon and vanilla, and sweetened with sugar. All the ingredients are crushed together in a special mortar, and heated over coals. The powdered mixture is then shaped into discs, which can be bought in specialist stores.	\N	\N	32	4	3	4	t	4	hot-chocolate.jpg	0

144	Cantaloupe Melon Salad	When you need just a small amount of sifted icing (confectioners') sugar, use a tea strainer. Spoon the sugar into the strainer, then lightly tap the side with the spoon so that the sifted sugar drifts down evenly. Though tempting when you're in a hurry, mashing the sugar in the strainer will not quicken the time it takes to sift through!	\N	\N	40	5	3	4	t	90112	cantaloupe-melon-salad.jpg	0
