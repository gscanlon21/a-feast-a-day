17	Vegetarian Stir-Fry	Save time and money by purchasing a package of frozen vegetables. These vegetables are typically picked at their peak and frozen quickly to lock in their natural nutrients while also maintaining flavor. The seasoning from the rice, oil, and sauce will provide plenty of flavors to keep this meal from being anything but bland. For the true vegan, skip the egg and garnish the dish with either bean sprouts or sliced chives. (Prep Time: 5 minutes. Cook Time: 25 minutes. Serves 2 – 4)	\N	\N	4	15	5	2	t	0	vegetable-stir-fry.jpg

33	Completely Crock Pot Spaghetti and Meatballs	You can vary the amount of pasta or meatballs according to your taste. Just make sure that the pasta is submerged in the liquid before you start the crock pot.  You can also add more ingredients—some chopped onion or garlic if your family likes it, or some shredded carrots would add flavor and nutrition. You could add some chicken or beef broth in place of the water for a more flavorful dish.  Top the cooked pasta and meatballs with some grated Parmesan cheese. For a complete meal, all you need is some toasted garlic bread and a green salad tossed with mushrooms and avocados.	\N	\N	4	360	10	6	t	32	spaghetti-meatballs.jpg
34	Crockpot Applesauce Kielbasa	You can use any fully-cooked sausage in place of the kielbasa if you'd like. This recipe can also be served as a main dish over some rice pilaf or cooked pasta; anything to soak up the delicious sauce. In that case, cut the sausages into 2-inch pieces.  If serving as an appetizer, use little toothpicks to get the sausages from the sauce.	\N	\N	4	120	5	2	t	1	kielbasa.jpg
