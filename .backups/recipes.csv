33	Completely Crock Pot Spaghetti and Meatballs	You can vary the amount of pasta or meatballs according to your taste. Just make sure that the pasta is submerged in the liquid before you start the crock pot.  You can also add more ingredients—some chopped onion or garlic if your family likes it, or some shredded carrots would add flavor and nutrition. You could add some chicken or beef broth in place of the water for a more flavorful dish.  Top the cooked pasta and meatballs with some grated Parmesan cheese. For a complete meal, all you need is some toasted garlic bread and a green salad tossed with mushrooms and avocados.	\N	\N	4	360	10	6	t	0	spaghetti-meatballs.jpg	0	\N	f

137	Meatballs	\N	\N	\N	0	25	5	12	t	0	meatballs.jpg	0	https://www.mamaknowsglutenfree.com/gluten-free-meatballs/ - For dairy-free option: use unsweetened almond milk and dairy-free bread crumbs. Store leftovers in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. To freeze: Once the gluten-free meatballs are completely cooled, the meatballs will need to be flash frozen first. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Transfer the frozen, cooked meatballs to freezer bags or freezer-safe containers and place them in your freezer. To reheat: The meatballs easily heated up in the oven, microwave or in a pot of spaghetti sauce. You can also defrosted the meatballs overnight in the refrigerator. To make ahead: Cover the raw meatballs as instructed with plastic wrap or an air-tight container and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.	f
138	Warm Chicken and Vegetable Salad	Use other lean meat, such as turkey breast, or lean cuts of beef or pork, in place of the chicken.	Too many ingredients.	\N	4	10	7	6	t	0	chicken-vegetable-salad.jpg	0	\N	f
139	Crock Pot Salsa Chicken	I like Clint's Mild Salsa, which is gluten free. You may use 2 Tablespoons of my Large Batch Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix in place of the blend listed above. Feel free to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs — or a mixture of these and chicken breasts — to equal 2lbs. To store: cool the shredded chicken then scoop into a storage container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for 3-4 days. To freeze: cool the shredded chicken then scoop into a gallon-size freezer bag, remove the air, seal, and freeze flat for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator. To make freezer meal packs: add the uncooked ingredients into a gallon-size freezer bag then remove the air, seal, and freeze flat for up to 6 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator before following recipe directions. How to use the shredded salsa chicken: Nachos: dollop tortilla chips with shredded chicken and cheese then melt in the oven and load up with your favorite toppings. Tacos: fill crunchy taco shells with shredded chicken then add your toppings. Enchiladas: use the flavorful salsa chicken as the filling in Chicken Enchiladas. Burritos: roll salsa chicken with cooked rice, beans, salsa, and cheese in your favorite large tortilla. Tostadas: toast corn tortillas then spread with Creamy Pinto Beans, the shredded salsa chicken, and shredded cheese. Melt then dollop with guacamole. Soups: add the tex-mex chicken to Restaurant-Style Chicken Tortilla Soup to save yourself a step. Salads: chill the shredded chicken then add to lettuce with shredded cheese, black beans, tomatoes, green onions, and tortilla strips. Serve with a mixture of equal parts salsa and ranch dressing. Burrito Bowls: pair the shredded chicken with cilantro lime rice, black beans, and all the fresh fixins. Quesadillas: pair with shredded cheese and tortillas then crisp to a golden crunch. Dip in a mixture of equal parts salsa and guacamole.	\N	\N	4	300	5	4	t	1073742848	crock-pot-salsa-chicken.jpg	0	https://iowagirleats.com/crock-pot-salsa-chicken/#recipe-card	f
140	Spiced Chicken Risotto with Mint	Use the same quantity of pumpkin or butternut squash in place of the carrots. To make a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and add a drained 400g/14oz can of chickpeas to the rice just before the end of cooking.	\N	\N	6	15	5	4	t	0	gluten-free-risotto.jpg	0	\N	f
141	Chicken Fried Rice	If you don't have any cold cooked rice in the refrigerator, you can still make this stir-fry if you have a couple of pouches of instant or express long grain or basmati rice in the cupboard. This type of rice cooks in under 2 minutes. For a stir-fry, the rice should be cold, so spread it out on a baking sheet after cooking and fan it to cool it quickly.	\N	\N	4	10	5	4	t	0	chicken-fried-rice.jpg	0	\N	f
142	Frothy Hot Chocolate	You could use Mexican chocolate, which is flavoured with almonds, cinnamon and vanilla, and sweetened with sugar. All the ingredients are crushed together in a special mortar, and heated over coals. The powdered mixture is then shaped into discs, which can be bought in specialist stores.	\N	\N	32	4	3	4	t	0	hot-chocolate.jpg	0	\N	f

144	Cantaloupe Melon Salad	When you need just a small amount of sifted icing (confectioners') sugar, use a tea strainer. Spoon the sugar into the strainer, then lightly tap the side with the spoon so that the sifted sugar drifts down evenly. Though tempting when you're in a hurry, mashing the sugar in the strainer will not quicken the time it takes to sift through!	\N	\N	40	5	3	4	t	1099536793600	cantaloupe-melon-salad.jpg	0	\N	f

150	Spiced Lentils	True Puy lentils come from the region of France, Le Puy, which has a unique climate and colcanic soil in which the lentils thrive. Always pick over lentils very carefully before cooking them to remove any little stones that may be among them.

152	Spaghetti with Lemon	Spaghetti is the best type of pasta for this recipe, because the olive oil and lemon juice cling to its long thin strands.

322	Crockpot Christmas Crack	Not every bag of chocolate chips has the same amount. It's okay if your bag has a little less or a little more. Add the ingredients into you Crockpot or slow cooker in the order they are listed. This is very important. White chocolate doesn't melt if it has direct contact with the bottom of the slow cooker, it just clumps and burns. Don't stir your ingredient before they are done heating up. The heat will transfer up through the ingredients and soften all of the chocolate chips. The magic happens when the hour is up and you stir everything together. The chocolate chips will melt and the flavors will combine. Let it set up in the refrigerator or freezer before serving. See notes in the post about a stove top version.	\N	\N	32	60	5	4	t	1073742848	\N	0	https://www.glutenfreepalate.com/crockpot-christmas-crack/	f

388	Gluten-Free Fried Rice	Use day-old rice for the best results, but freshly cooked can be used in a pinch. Cook the rice and then lay it out on a baking sheet in the fridge for 30 mins before using. Make sure your soy sauce is gluten-free. To Store: Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To Reheat: Heat over medium heat on the stovetop or in the microwave. Add a little water if it looks dry. Only reheat fried rice made with freshly cooked rice. Rice shouldn’t be reheated more than once.	\N	\N	6	10	20	4	t	4194308	\N	0	https://www.mamaknowsglutenfree.com/gluten-free-fried-rice/#wprm-recipe-container-24106	f

392	Roasted Chickpeas	Let the chickpeas cool completely on the baking sheet after roasting. They will continue to crisp up as they cool.

Enjoy roasted chickpeas as a crunchy snack, a salad or soup topper, in grain bowls, or as part of a party mix with nuts, pretzels, and dried fruit. 	\N	\N	16	35	10	4	t	2097154	\N	0	https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/roasted-chickpeas/	f
