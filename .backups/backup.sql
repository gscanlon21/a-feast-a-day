1	Food experts recommend rinsing dry rice before cooking it because it helps wash away contaminants, heavy metals, dirt and bugs that may be in the rice.	\N	1
2	When reheating rice in the microwave, put a little bit of water in the bowl so it heats up fluffy again.	\N	1
3	Holding a freshly boiled egg under cold water helps to prevent the yolk from acquiring a greenish tinge where it meets the white.	\N	1
4	Lemon juice prevents avocado flesh from discolouring once it is exposed to air.	\N	1
5	Keep pancakes warm by wrapping them in foil and placing them in the oven at a low temperature.	\N	1
6	A 4-quart saute pan is enough for cooking for two.	\N	1
7	A recent study found that restricting sugar in the first 1,000 days of life (after conception and up to 2 years of age) reduced the lifetime risk of diabetes by 35%, the risk of hypertension by 20%, and the risk of obesity by 30%.	https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn5421	8
8	Gluten is often pointed to as a culprit in autoimmune thyroid diseases (Graves and Hashimoto’s). However, a 2003 study showed that only about 5% of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis also had immune reactions to gluten. While that isn’t a huge percentage, it may be worth trialing a gluten-free diet if you have an autoimmune thyroid disease.	https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/thyroid-issues-and-genetics/	4

2181	Place sugar in your food processor or blender. Any small chopper or even a coffee bean grinder works. (Process in batches if needed.) You can skip the food processor/blender and just mix the sugar and vanilla bean seeds in a bowl with a whisk, but you’ll get better flavor if you pulse the two together.	\N	237	0
2182	Cut the vanilla bean pod in half lengthwise. Use a knife to scrape out the seeds. Place the seeds on top of the sugar. (Save the empty beans/pods.) Use a spoon or another knife to scrape the seeds off the knife—they’re sticky and clumpy.	\N	237	1
2183	Pulse/blend/whisk until all the seeds are broken up and blended, about 10-12 pulses. If you notice extra large clumps, feel free to keep pulsing/whisking or sift them out. Pour vanilla sugar into your jar or container.	\N	237	2
2184	Submerge the empty bean/pod into the sugar. Cut it as needed to fit. This is actually optional, but the empty bean adds more flavor as the weeks go on. You could also use the empty beans to make vanilla extract. See written details above this recipe.	\N	237	3
2185	Use sugar immediately or wait at least 2 weeks for optimal flavor.	\N	237	4
2186	Store vanilla sugar at room temperature. Give it a shake every few weeks because it can clump up. If stored in a cool, dry place, vanilla sugar has a long shelf life, 2+ years at least. (I guarantee you’ll use it up before then!)	\N	237	5
2187	Pour the milk into a small pan and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat. Mix the expresso or very strong coffee with 500ml/16fl oz/2 cups of the boiled milk in a large heatproof jug (pitcher). Sweeten with vanilla sugar to taste.	\N	169	0

2915	Preheat the oven to 350°F. Halve the cherry tomatoes, peel and finely slice the garlic, and tear the bread into bite-sized chunks. Place it all in a 14x12-inch roasting pan, pour in the beans and their juice, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and red wine vinegar, add a splash of water, and mix it all together. Quickly pinch and twist each chipolata in the middle to make two mini ones, then randomly dot them around your bake, lightly pressing them into the beans and tomatoes.	\N	320	0
2916	Roast for 45 minutes, or until everything is golden, bubbling, and delicious.	\N	320	1
2918	Flip the chicken over, spoon over the sauce, then transfer to the broiler, roughly 4 inches from the heat, for 5 minutes, or until gnarly and cooked through. Finely grate over the remaining lime zest, then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.	\N	321	1
2479	Pour the tablespoon of vinegar into a 1 cup measurer.  Fill the rest of the 1 cup measurer with milk. 	\N	262	0
2480	Gently stir and let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes. This will allow the milk to slightly curdle, giving it a buttermilk-like texture and taste.	\N	262	1
961	Finely slice the pancetta, then place in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a generous pinch of black pepper and cook for 4 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Add the asparagus to the pancetta for 3 minutes, then drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of starchy cooking water.	\N	104	1
962	Tip the pasta into the pancetta pan, toss and stir everything together, then remove from the heat and wait 2 minutes for the pan to cool slightly (if the pan's too hot, it'll scramble; get it right and it'll be smooth, silky and deliciously elegant).	\N	104	2
963	Loosen the egg mixture with a spash of cooking water, then pour over the pasta, tossing and stirring vigorously - the egg will gently cook in the residual heat. Season to perfection.

2925	Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the package instructions, then drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water. Meanwhile, squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins, then, with wet hands, quickly shape into 18 even-sized balls.

2926	Finely chop the parsley, stalks and all, beat it with the egg and a splash of pasta cooking water, then finely graze and mix in most of the Parmesan.	\N	323	1
2927	Toss the grained pasta into the sausage pan, pour in the egg mixture, and toss for 1 minute off the heat (the egg will gently cook in the residual heat). Loosen with a good splash of reserved cooking water, season to perfection with sea salt and pepper, and finely grate over the remaining Parmesan.	\N	323	2
2932	Put a 10-inch non-stick frying pan on a high heat and pour in 1 cup of water. Halve the eggplant lengthways, quickly slash the flesh of each half a few times and place skin-side up in the pan, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until it boils dry and begins to sizzle (listen for the change in sound). Meanwhile, trim the scallions. Cut the whites into 1¼-inch lengths at an angle and put aside. Seed the chili and finely slice lengthways with the green part of the scallions. Place both in a bowl of ice-cold water and put aside to crisp up.	\N	326	0
2635	Toast the seeds in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until lightly golden, tossing regularly, then remove. Put three-quarters of the seeds into a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt, and pound until fairly fine. Peel and add the garlic, then smash to a paste. Squeeze in the lemon juice, then muddle in 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and a tiny drebble of red wine vinegar to make a delicious tahini-style dressing.	\N	263	0
2636	Wash the carrots, then finely slice into matchsticks with a good knife or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!). Core and slice the apples the same way, then toss both with the tahini dressing. Taste, season to perfection with salt and black pepper, then scatter over the remaining seeds.	\N	263	1
2928	Combine buttermilk and heavy cream in a non-reactive container. Cover and allow to rest at room temperature until thickened to desired texture, about 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.	\N	324	0
2933	When the eggplant starts to sizze, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the white scallions, and the peanuts to the pan, stirring regularly. After 2 minutes, add a splash of water, drizzle in the teriyaki, and reduce to a medium heat. Turn the eggplant, jiggle the pan and let it get sticky for a few minutes, then dish up, sprinkled with the drained green scallions and chili.	\N	326	1
1825	Make a spicy relish by cooking the remaining shallot with the garlic and green chilli in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes, until softened.	\N	173	2
1826	Add the canned ratatouille to the pan containing the vegetables. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.	\N	173	3
1827	Meanwhile, preheat the grill (broiler) and cook the burgers for about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked through. Meanwhile, split the burger buns. Arrange lettuce leaves on the bun bases, add the burgers and top with warm relish and the bun tops. 	\N	173	4
2966	To make a quick chili oil, halve and seed the chilies. Fill a clean heatproof jar with olive oil, then pour it into a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat and add the chilies to confit. Meanwhile, put a pan of boiling salted water on for the pasta. Halve the eggplants lengthways and blanch in the water, covered, for 5 minutes, then lift out, leaving the water to boil. Carefully scoop the soft chilies into the jar, then spoon in the oil, leaving 2 tablespoons in the pan (keep the jar of chili oil to add a kick to future meals). Chop the eggplant into 1¼-inch chunks, add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then turn the heat up to high, stirring regularly.	\N	360	0
2967	Cook the pasta according to the package instructions while you peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry with the eggplant for 2 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and half a can's worth of water. Add as many chilies as you dare to the sauce and simmer until the pasta is ready, then taste and season to perfection. Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then toss the pasta through the sauce, loosening with a little reserved cooking water, if needed. Dish up.	\N	360	1
2968	Scrub the beets clean, reserving any nice leaves, then finely slice into matchsticks with good knife skills or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!). Dress with ½ a tablespoon each of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, the horseradish, and crème fraîche, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Delicately toss with the watercress and any reserved beet leaves.	\N	361	0
2969	Divide up the bresaola between your plates, followed by the beet salad, then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil, and serve.	\N	361	1
2970	Arrange the bresaola slices on your plates. Beat the eggs well. Get a 10-inch non-stick frying pan nice and hot on a medium heat, then add a drizzle of olive oil and wipe it around and out with a ball of paper towel. Pour in just enough egg to thinly cover the base of the pan, swirling it up around the sides and pouring any excess back into your bowl, almost like an egg pancake. As soon as it's set, use a rubber spatula to ease it away at the sides, and out onto a board. Repeat with the remaining egg. Cool, roll up, and finely slice.	\N	362	0
2971	Trim and finely slice the endives. Dress with the lemon juice and ½ a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, then toss with the egg ribbons, taste, and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Pile in the center of the bresaola, shave over the Parmesan, then finish with a little extra virgin olive oil.	\N	362	1
2368	Process until completely smooth and creamy. This may take 5 minutes or so, depending on your food processor. You will need to scrape down the sides intermittently to ensure everything gets incorporated.	\N	254	2
2965	Place all of the above ingredients in a high-speed blender and enjoy right away.	\N	359	0
2973	Place the chicken breasts between two large sheets of parchment paper, and whack with the base of a large non-stick frying pan to flatten them to about ½ inch thick. Tear the bread into a food processor, then peel, chop, and add the garlic, and blitz into fairly fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs over the chicken, roughly pat onto each side, then re-cover with the paper and whack again, to hammer the crumbs into the chicken and flatten them further.	\N	364	0
2974	Put the pan on a medium heat. Fry the crumbled chicken 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side, or until crisp, golden, and cooked through. Slice, plate up, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle with lemon-dressed arugula, and serve with lemon wedges, for squeezing over.	\N	364	1
2975	Preheat the oven to 400°F. Halve any large potatoes. Trim the fennel, pick and reserve any leafy tops, finely slice the stalky part, then halve the bulb and cut into ½-inch slices. Put it all into a 12x14-inch roasting pan, halve the artichokes and add with 2 tablespoons of oil from the jar, as well as a really good pinch of black pepper, then toss it all together. Pour in 1¼ cups of water, cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, and back for 1 hour.	\N	365	0
2976	In a bowl, finely grate half the Parmesan into the cream and loosen with a splash of water. When the time's up, remove the pan from the oven, discard the foil, spoon over the cream mixture, and finely grate over the remaining Parmesan. Bake for a final 20 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, then sprinkle over any reserved fennel tops before serving.	\N	365	1
2977	Cover cucumbers with boiling water. Let stand until next morning; drain. Repeat procedure the next 3 mornings. On the fifth day, drain and slice in 1/2-inch pieces.

2978	Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Trim and finely slice the scallions and fry with 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 1 minute. Add the rice, chili jam, a splash of water, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then toss for 2 minutes until everything is well coated.	\N	367	0
2979	Push the rice to the sides of the pan, making a big well in the middle. Crack the eggs into the well, then use a rubber spatula to start gently moving the eggs around to create big curds. Break in the tofu, then fold the rice back through the egg until it's all looking good. Taste and season to perfection. Lightly oil the inside of a bowl, add the egg-fried rice, genly compacting it with the spatula, then proudly turn out onto a plate, retro style.	\N	367	1
2980	Place rhubarb pieces in a medium pot; sprinkle with sugar. Stir well to ensure rhubarb is completely coated with sugar; cover and let rest for 15 minutes, stirring once so natural juices are released.	\N	368	0
2981	Bring rhubarb mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Reduce heat; simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Serve compote warm.	\N	368	1
2640	Put a grill pan on high heat. Cut the two cheeks off the mango, slice each into three lengthways, then slice off the skin and discard. Dice all of the flech into ½-inch cubes. Scrunch the stone over a bowl, to extract any pulp and juice, mix with the hoisin to make a dressing, and divide between two little bowls.	\N	270	0
2641	Flatten the chicken breasts by pounding them with your fists until the fat end is the same thickness as the skinny end. Rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. then grill for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until bar-marked and cooked through.

1744	Finally, add the eggs, and scramble with the ingredients until cooked to your preference. Serve.	\N	17	3
2982	Preheat the oven to 350°F. Quickly scrub the sweet potatoes clean, then slice into 1¼-inch rounds. Place in a 10x12-inch roasting pan with the whole unpeeled garlic bulb, and toss with 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the Cajun spice. Arrange in a flat layer and roast for 1 hour, or until soft, gnarly, and carmelized.	\N	369	0
2983	Once done, squeeze all the soft, sweet, creamy, mild roasted garlic out of the skins into the yogurt, mash together, then season to perfection. Trim and finely slice the scallions.

2988	Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the package instructions. Meanwhile, peel the garlic. Tear the stems out of the cavolo and discard, adding the leaves and the garlic to the pasta pan for 5 minutes. Pour 1½ tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a blender, then finely grate in the Parmesan. Use tongs to carefully transfer the cavolo leaves and garlic straight into the blender and blitz for a few minutes until super-smooth. Taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper.	\N	371	0
2989	Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water. Return the pasta to the pan and toss with the vibrant green sauce, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed, then divide between your plates.

2991	Dip the crackers in the hummus. Enjoy!	\N	373	0
2815	In 2-quart saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Cook onion in butter about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Stir in flour, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly; remove from heat. Stir in milk. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute.	\N	23	1
2817	Cover and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving (sauce thickens as it stands).	\N	23	3
